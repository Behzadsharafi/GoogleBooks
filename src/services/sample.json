It's based on the experiences of the author, Yevgeniy (Jim) Brikman, as well as interviews with programmers from some of the most successful startups of the last decade, including Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Stripe, Instagram, AdMob, Pinterest, and many others. Hello, Startup is a practical, how-to guide that consists of three parts: Products, Technologies, and Teams. Although at its core, this is a book for programmers, by programmers, only Part II (Technologies) is significantly technical, while the rest should be accessible to technical and non-technical audiences alike. If you’re at all interested in startups—whether you’re a programmer at the beginning of your career, a seasoned developer bored with large company politics, or a manager looking to motivate your engineers—this book is for you.",

        "publishedDate": "2010-03-30",
        "description": "There’s a reason the media has dubbed matchmaker Rachel Greenwald as “The Wife Maker.” Yes, she’s responsible for over 750 marriages, but more importantly, she has solved perhaps the biggest dating mystery of all time: when you finally meet Mr. Right (or even Mr. Potential), what really compels him to call back (or not) after a date? Armed with her Harvard MBA, Rachel embarked on a fascinating ten-year research project to decipher this puzzle. In Have Him at Hello, she applies her business savvy to the dating world by conducting in-depth “exit interviews” with 1,000 single men, asking why they called back one woman, but not another. By refusing to accept the post-date brush-off like “There wasn’t any chemistry…” or the excited, but equally vague evening recap, “We hit it off!” Rachel extracted unabashedly honest and raw details. It turns out there are clear, tangible, consistent reasons why marriage-minded men either fall for you or disappear. The surprising “Top 5 Date Makers” and “Top 10 Date Breakers” revealed in this book can actually change your fate when Mr. Right finally comes along. Rachel’s goal isn’t for you to pretend to be someone you’re not, but rather to keep the ball in your court. By using her innovative research and tips as a guide, more men will ask to see you again ; then you can do the selecting, rather than wondering if they’ll call. Because information is power, this book will make your first hello a lasting one.",

It was made up of two things: the exciting new world of home computers, and worries about nuclear war. There were certainly no girls in it. But then he met Penny, who’s into pop music, and somehow manages to be optimistic about life, despite having a very difficult mother. (Difficult, as in, she sometimes throws roof tiles at people.) For the first time since the death of his own mother three years ago, Tim starts to see a whole new possibility in life. Then he loses Penny. So what else is there to do but climb onto the school roof and wait for the world to end?",

Conley Hawkins left her family’s small town newspaper, The Silver Bay Beacon, in the rearview mirror years ago. Now a star reporter for a big-city paper, Conley is exactly where she wants to be and is about to take a fancy new position in Washington, D.C. Or so she thinks. For small town scandals... When the new job goes up in smoke, Conley finds herself right back where she started, working for her sister, who is trying to keep The Silver Bay Beacon afloat—and she doesn’t exactly have warm feelings for Conley. Soon she is given the unenviable task of overseeing the local gossip column, “Hello, Summer.” And big-time secrets. Then Conley witnesses an accident that ends in the death of a local congressman—a beloved war hero with a shady past. The more she digs into the story, the more dangerous it gets. As an old heartbreaker causes trouble and a new flame ignites, it soon looks like their sleepy beach town is the most scandalous hotspot of the summer.",

Flex also provides powerful data handling for industrial-strength applications. We think it should be just as much fun to learn Flex as it is to use it. And we know that fun learning gets better results. Hello! Flex 4 demonstrates how to get started without getting bogged down in technical detail or academic edge cases. In this book, User Friendly cartoon characters offer commentary and snide side comments, as the book moves quickly from Hello World into practical techniques. Each one is illustrated with a hands-on example. Along the way, readers will build a unique Flex application that mashes Yahoo Maps with Twitter to keep track of friends. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.",

        "description": "Remarkable scientific research, mapping the human genome, reveals how similar we all are to each other. Only a tiny fraction of difference separates us one from another. Each of us says \"Hello\" to our individual experience here on earth, and each of us will ultimately and assuredly say \"Goodbye.\" Between those landmark events in our lives, there are all kinds and types of \"Hellos\" and \"Goodbyes,\" some happy; some sad; some funny-and all part of the amazing school called life. This book awakens us to both the glitter, and sometimes the gloom, that life presents on an almost daily basis. It awakens a realization that life is truly important and meaningful, and that each day is a gift to be opened and treasured.",

        "description": "On February 20, 2014, media queen Oprah Winfrey launched a campaign on CNN against loneliness; she named her initiative, “Just Say Hello!” She also named as her campaign partners her long-time best friend, “CBS This Morning” co-Anchor Gayle King, and CNN’s chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta to \"help fight loneliness, lift spirits, and brighten days to save lives\". Researchers have said loneliness can cut off a lifespan by ten years. Oprah’s initiative, if successful, could add ten years of existence to lonely lives, but Oprah is not the first celebrity to launch such altruistic enterprise: Stevie Wonder went that route in 1984 with \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\", and in 1985, Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Quincy Jones and a host of superstars with \"We Are the World\". Had those earlier initiatives succeeded, Oprah’s campaign might not be necessary. But, there are also available often overlooked very precious time-tested scientifically backed biblical formulas for combating loneliness some of which are cited in this book in the hope that, perhaps, Oprah and her team may consider using their celebrity positions to help America focus on the things of GOD. For, “no eye has seen, nor ear has heard, and human mind has conceived the things God has prepared for those who love him” (1Cor. 2:9). Hz",

        "description": "In 1918, the U.S. Army Signal Corps sent 223 women to France at General Pershing’s explicit request. They were masters of the latest technology: the telephone switchboard. While suffragettes picketed the White House and President Wilson struggled to persuade a segregationist Congress to give women of all races the vote, these courageous young women swore the army oath and settled into their new roles. Elizabeth Cobbs reveals the challenges they faced in a war zone where male soldiers wooed, mocked, and ultimately celebrated them. The army discharged the last Hello Girls in 1920, the year Congress ratified the Nineteenth Amendment. When they sailed home, they were unexpectedly dismissed without veterans’ benefits and began a sixty-year battle that a handful of survivors carried to triumph in 1979. “What an eye-opener! Cobbs unearths the original letters and diaries of these forgotten heroines and weaves them into a fascinating narrative with energy and zest.” —Cokie Roberts, author of Capital Dames “This engaging history crackles with admiration for the women who served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during the First World War, becoming the country’s first female soldiers.” —New Yorker “Utterly delightful... Cobbs very adroitly weaves the story of the Signal Corps into that larger story of American women fighting for the right to vote, but it’s the warm, fascinating job she does bringing her cast...to life that gives this book its memorable charisma... This terrific book pays them a long-warranted tribute.” —Christian Science Monitor “Cobbs is particularly good at spotlighting how closely the service of military women like the Hello Girls was tied to the success of the suffrage movement.” —NPR",

        "description": "During his birth on Christmas Day 1916 under a circling, grenade-dropping German warplane, Albert Torreele was blinded in one eye by a panicked midwife. That did not stop him on his tenacious path towards officerhood. He graduated from the Royal Military Academy in Brussels just in time to lead an ill-fated platoon straight into the German onslaught of May 10, 1940. A single shot that should have left him crippled sent him on a grueling odyssey, though his tumbling country to the edge of the hell of Dunkirk, and across the English Channel to the charming seaside town of Tenby where the Belgian forces regrouped and prepared for another chance to fight. Finding old friends and true love in Wales, Albert and his comrades of the Free Belgian Forces set their minds on a single goal - cross the English Channel, take back their home and free their families.",

        "description": "Hello Cleveland unlocks the hidden, larger-than life history and culture of Cleveland, Ohio, possibly the country's most misunderstood city. Locals, visitors, transplants, and people—who moved away as soon as they could—will gain a well-rounded picture of the city's passionate pursuits, dark corners, dubious claims to fame, and disarmingly friendly culture. Nick Perry, who grew up in Cleveland and then moved back as an adult, invites you to join him in taking a loving, brutally honest look under the hood. Develop an appreciation for local celebrities like Devo, Bone Thugs & Harmony, Lil' John and Big Chuck, and Dick Goddard the weather guy. Marvel at landmarks like the Great Lakes, the Metroparks, and the world's largest outdoor chandelier. There are plenty of downsides and none are sugarcoated. You'll discover why Cleveland is the reason for the creation of the Environmental Protection Act and how it's largely to blame for the widespread adoption of suburban city planning. But you can still find a heartwarming pride in rooting for sports teams that seem cursed to lose every championship. As the city's unofficial slogan says, \"You've got to be tough,\" but there's a lot to love—especially when the world-famous Cleveland Orchestra wanders into the dive bar you're sitting in and starts to play an impromptu concert.",

After making a startling discovery on Hossa, Norman must jump into action to ensure an important secret is kept safe from human exploitation. Unfortunately, Norman soon realizes Jason has different ideas. Convinced by Normans sudden departure from his companys payroll that he is being tricked out of a valuable ore find, Jason sends his best team to Hossa to reclaim what is rightfully his. Now only time will tell if Norman can pick up the gauntlet and somehow save the day, not just for the universe but also himself.

MacKenzie Knightley is the best criminal trial attorney in Damson County, but he has no defense against petite, peppery Sidonie Lindstrom, a foster mom who’s moved into the farmhouse where Mac and his brothers grew up. … he most assuredly is not! Sid is grieving the loss of her brother, worried she’s about to lose her foster care license, and in no mood for romantic nonsense when Mac drives up the lane. And yet, he’s good with her horses, good with her foster son, and just the sort of solid, trustworthy, guy she might fall for—until she learns that he’s not at all what he appears to be. NOTE: The Sweetest Kisses series was originally published in 2015, and went on hiatus in 2022. The republished versions are slightly revised and sporting spiffy new covers!",
