# Google Books

A single page that enables the users to search for books and get more details about a certain title. I used React.JS and SCSS for front-end and utilized google books API as the backend.

## Technologies

Frontend:

- ![React Icon](./src/assets/React.png) React
- ![SCSS Icon](./src/assets/Sass.png) SCSS

Backend: Google Books API

## Build Steps

1. Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:your-username/React-eShop.git
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd portfolio
3. Install the necessary dependencies: npm install
4. Start the application: npm run dev

## Features

- The user can search by title, author, genre, etc.
- By clicking on each result a modal opens with more information about the title.

## Future Goals

- Adding pagination to the available items.
- Adding tests to the components.
